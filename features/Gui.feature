Senario: Grading a Poster

So that I can grade posters

I want to have a process for grading the individual attributes for each poster in the competition.

Feature: Poster grading

Given that I click on a Poster 

I should be taken to the Poster's

Given That I am on the correct Posters's Page

I should see three critera for grading the Poster

The criteria should be Graded 1 - 10

When I click on a Number 1 - 10

That number for the criteria should be Highlighted

The number Selected for each Critea should be saved to the poster as an total score
